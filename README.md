# Get Outdoors Mobile App

This is my senior project for my B.A. in Computer Science.

The Get Outdoors is a full-stack mobile application. It is very similar to AllTrails or other trail finders, and is compatible with both Android and IOS.

## Built With

- **React Native**
- **Spring Boot**
- **MySQL**

## Installation & Usage

I have no plans to deploy this application to production, so using it is only recommended in a testing environment. It is not available in any app stores.

For full functionality, you must run the frontend application and the server separately and properly setup their connection. I have not tested running them on different machines, only locally on the same device.
